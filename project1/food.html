            <figcaption id = padslight>Figure 1: Balut is a distinctive and iconic Filipino delicacy that intrigues both locals 
                 and adventurous tourists alike. This fertilized duck egg, incubated for about 14 to 21 days before being boiled, 
                 offers a unique culinary experience. Eaten by cracking open the top of the shell, one first sips the savory broth 
                 before consuming the rich, creamy yolk and the partially developed duck embryo inside. Often seasoned with a pinch of salt, 
                 vinegar, or a dash of chili, balut is commonly sold by street vendors, particularly in the evenings, and is cherished for its
                 complex flavors and textures. Despite its initial shock value to some, balut remains a beloved and culturally significant snack
                 that highlights the bold and diverse palate of Filipino cuisine.</figcaption>

            <figcaption id = padslight>Figure 2: Halo-halo, which means "mix-mix" in Filipino, is a vibrant and refreshing dessert 
                 that epitomizes the rich culinary heritage of the Philippines. Served in a tall glass or bowl, halo-halo is
                 a delightful medley of shaved ice, sweetened condensed milk, and an array of ingredients such as sweetened fruits,
                 beans, jellies, nata de coco, and a topping of leche flan or ube (purple yam) ice cream. Each spoonful offers a unique 
                 combination of flavors and textures, from the crunch of the ice to the chewiness of the jellies and the creaminess of the
                 flan. Perfect for cooling down during the tropical summer months, halo-halo is a staple in Filipino households and eateries,
                 celebrated for its ability to bring together a diverse range of tastes into one harmonious and delicious treat.</figcaption>
